## Week of 11/29 - 12/05 
### Proposed
This is week is our very first week after of development after our project proposal confirmation. For this week our plan is get as much work done as possible since finals are nearing. 

We plan to accomplish the following:
- Get our OpenFlights raw data processsed and setup as csv files 
- Read csv files and constructs graph data structure (best suitable for our project requirements and goals)
- Implement our first versions of graph traversals and Dijkastra's aalgorithm (more focused on error-free and correct execution of desired results)
- Have 1-2 hour of meetup with my team to prepare an informal deliverable for our mid-project checkin

Also, if time remain...
- one or more of our teammates would work on code readability for implemented code so far 
- implemented test cases

## Week of 12/06 - 12/13
### Proposed
This is our second week of development. We now plan on completing the project and all of our graph algorithm implementations. 
We plan to accomplish the following:

- Finish implementing Dijkastra's and betweeness centriality algorithm completely in our codebase
- Make sure our codebase is functional and is reaady for submission
- Work a little bit more on code readabiity and make sure it works efficiently
- Meet up before  December 13 to make sure our final deliverables are in place

## Weekend of 12/11 - 12/12 and Day of 12/13 (Last 3 Days Completion Plan)
### Proposed
This is our plan for the weekend and the first day of third week. We now plan to wrap up our final project. 

For the things **already** accomplished for this week's first half:
- Finished implemntation of Dijkstra's algorithm 
- cleaned up codebase for readibility 
- made code modular and abstrast 

For the things to accomplish by the end of the weekend:
- Finish implementation of betweenness centrality 
- complette test cases for code implemented so far
- complete presentation slides and record presentation 
- complete peer evaluation
